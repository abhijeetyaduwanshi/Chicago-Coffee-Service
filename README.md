Project name: Chicago-Coffee-Service

Author: Abhijeet Yaduwanshi

Project for: Internet Technologies and Web Design course.

Skills used: HTML- 5, external CSS and Google maps API.


This is a website for Chicago coffee service to showcase their products and services to prospective vendors.
There are 4 pages in the website. Starting with "index" as the "Home" page followed by "about us", "products & services" and "contact us" pages, all the css files related to the pages are with the same names. I created a master style-sheet named less.css for reusability and maintainability with which I maintained header and footer consistently throughout the website. The content of the website is self-explanatory with images for great user experience.
I used google fonts API on the web pages. I also used google maps in the "contact us" page to help users locate the store.


Development environment:
I have a windows 8.1 dell inspiron 15, 3000 series laptop.
I have used sublime3 text editor.
I used google chrome browser to test the project.


Steps to test the project:
Download the zip file to your local machine. Extract the zip folder. There will be 11 files and 1 folder.
Right click the index.html> open with> google chrome (download google chrome if you donâ€™t have one).
Now you can navigate through the website with the navigation links on the page.
